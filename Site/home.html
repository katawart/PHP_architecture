					Hunt I.T. offers website design services designed around your business. <br />
					Most companies advertise online and a key part of your advertising campaign should be your website.<br />
					Our starter package for a five page website is only £250. For example: Home, Services, News, About Us amd Contact Us pages.<br />
					Our websites are object orientated (OO) which means they are more dynamic and can be changed and updated with greater ease than most basic sites. 
					This means that when you feel it is time to go to the next level of sophistication you won't need the whole site redesigned. 
					We also provide project documentation so you can see what went into making your site.<br/>
					<p>We have a section on frequently asked questions regarding website design if you want to know more. 
					If you don't see what you want then just <a href='contactUs.php'>contact us here</a>.</p>
